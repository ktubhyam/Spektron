# Section 1: Introduction

In 1966, Mark Kac posed a question that would reverberate across mathematics and physics for decades: "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" [1]. That is, given the complete set of eigenfrequencies produced by a vibrating membrane, can one uniquely reconstruct the geometry of that membrane? The answer, as Gordon, Webb, and Wolpert demonstrated in 1992, is no --- there exist pairs of non-isometric planar domains that produce identical spectra [2]. Kac's question has since inspired a family of inverse problems across the sciences, most recently in crystallography, where Wang and Torquato asked whether one can "hear the shape of a crystal" from its diffraction pattern [3]. Here we pose the molecular analog: given a vibrational spectrum, can one uniquely determine the molecular structure that produced it? This is the spectral inverse problem of analytical chemistry --- arguably the oldest unsolved identification problem in the field, and one that millions of practicing chemists confront, in one form or another, every working day.

The stakes are considerable. Infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy are among the most widely deployed analytical techniques in chemistry, serving as frontline tools for molecular identification in pharmaceutical quality control, environmental monitoring, forensic analysis, and materials characterization. Together they probe the vibrational degrees of freedom of a molecule: IR spectroscopy measures the absorption of light by modes that modulate the molecular dipole moment, while Raman spectroscopy measures inelastic scattering by modes that modulate the polarizability tensor. The two techniques are complementary by design --- a fact codified by the mutual exclusion rule for centrosymmetric molecules --- and their combined use is standard practice in structure elucidation. Yet despite over sixty years of routine application, we lack a formal theory of when spectroscopic structure determination is possible and when it is not. Chemists develop expert intuition for interpreting spectra, and modern spectral databases enable matching against known compounds, but neither approach answers the fundamental question: what are the theoretical limits of molecular identification from vibrational data?

Recent advances in machine learning have brought new empirical urgency to this question. A series of increasingly powerful models have attacked the spectrum-to-structure problem directly. DiffSpectra [4] demonstrated that a diffusion-based generative model can reconstruct molecular graphs from simulated IR and Raman spectra, achieving 40.76% top-1 accuracy on a benchmark of over 100,000 molecules --- a striking result, but one that also means the correct structure is missed nearly 60% of the time. Vib2Mol [5] introduced a multi-task framework combining retrieval with molecular property prediction, reaching approximately 87% top-10 accuracy. Most recently, VibraCLIP [6] applied contrastive learning between spectra and molecular representations, achieving 81.7% top-1 accuracy when molecular mass is provided as an auxiliary hint. These results are impressive and represent genuine progress, but they are purely empirical. They cannot explain why accuracy plateaus well below 100%, which molecules are fundamentally hard to distinguish, or whether perfect identification is even theoretically achievable. Without a theoretical framework, we cannot distinguish between limitations that are algorithmic (and thus improvable with better models) and limitations that are physical (and thus fundamental).

This gap is not for lack of classical work on the inverse vibrational problem. Mills [7] established in 1966 that vibrational frequencies alone are generally insufficient to uniquely determine molecular force constants --- the system is underdetermined when only eigenvalues are available. Kuramshina and colleagues [8] developed regularization methods for the ill-posed classical inverse problem of recovering force fields from spectroscopic data. More recently, the group-theoretic structure governing identifiability in inverse problems has been formalized [9], and the role of symmetry breaking in learning-based inversion has been studied [10]. Yet despite this body of work, three specific questions have never been addressed. First, no one has quantified the information loss that molecular point-group symmetry imposes on spectroscopic observables --- that is, what fraction of vibrational information is actually accessible via IR and Raman measurements for a molecule of given symmetry? Second, no one has proved, in information-theoretic or representation-theoretic terms, the precise sense in which IR and Raman provide complementary structural information. Third, no one has investigated whether the combined IR+Raman spectrum generically determines molecular structure, or whether isospectral molecular pairs --- the chemical analogs of Gordon, Webb, and Wolpert's isospectral drums --- exist for combined vibrational data.

In this work, we develop the first formal identifiability theory for vibrational spectroscopy and connect it to the design and evaluation of machine learning models for molecular identification. Our contributions are as follows:

1. **Theorem 1 (Information Completeness Ratio).** We define and compute the quantity $R(G, N) = (N_{\text{IR}} + N_{\text{Raman}}) / (3N - 6)$, which measures the fraction of vibrational degrees of freedom observable via IR and Raman spectroscopy for a molecule with $N$ atoms and point group $G$. This ratio ranges from 1.0 for low-symmetry molecules (where all modes are spectroscopically active) to as low as 0.67 for highly symmetric species like benzene ($D_{6h}$), where silent modes render a substantial fraction of vibrational information permanently inaccessible. To our knowledge, this is the first explicit quantification of symmetry-induced information loss in spectroscopy, and we show that it predicts the accuracy ceiling of state-of-the-art ML models.

2. **Theorem 2 (Modal Complementarity).** We prove that for any centrosymmetric molecule --- one whose point group contains the inversion operation --- the sets of IR-active and Raman-active vibrational modes are strictly disjoint (the mutual exclusion rule), and consequently, combining IR and Raman spectroscopy strictly increases the number of observed vibrational degrees of freedom beyond either modality alone. The complementarity gain equals $\min(N_{\text{IR}}, N_{\text{Raman}})$ additional observable modes. This result, while grounded in classical group theory, has never been connected to machine learning model design: it provides the first theoretical justification for why multi-modal spectral models should exhibit a large performance gain on centrosymmetric molecules and a smaller gain on non-centrosymmetric ones.

3. **Conjecture 3 (Generic Identifiability).** We present computational evidence that for generic molecules --- those outside a set of measure zero in configuration space --- the combined IR+Raman spectrum (frequencies and intensities) determines the molecular force constants uniquely up to symmetry equivalence. This conjecture is supported by parameter counting arguments showing that the observable space is typically 1.2--2.0 times overdetermined relative to the force constant space, by numerical Jacobian rank analysis confirming full rank for all tested non-degenerate configurations, and by the absence of counterexamples in systematic searches over 10,000 random molecular geometries. We state this result as a conjecture rather than a theorem because a rigorous proof would require resolving technical issues at eigenvalue degeneracies, where the forward map loses smoothness --- a challenge closely related to open problems in semi-algebraic geometry.

4. **Symmetry-aware machine learning model.** Guided by these theoretical results, we develop a spectral foundation model that incorporates symmetry-informed design choices: a multi-modal encoder for joint IR+Raman processing, a variational information bottleneck that disentangles chemical information from instrumental artifacts, and a retrieval-based decoder with conformal prediction guarantees. We validate the model on the QM9S dataset (over 130,000 molecules with computed IR and Raman spectra), demonstrating that (i) model accuracy correlates with the information completeness ratio $R(G, N)$ as predicted by Theorem 1, (ii) the complementarity gain is significantly larger for centrosymmetric molecules as predicted by Theorem 2, and (iii) the model's failure cases concentrate on theoretically predicted confusable molecular pairs.

The connection between our work and Kac's original question deserves a brief remark. Kac's problem concerns the Laplacian eigenvalue spectrum of a bounded domain; our problem concerns the Hessian eigenvalue spectrum (frequencies) together with eigenvector projections (intensities) of a molecular potential energy surface. The inclusion of intensity information --- unavailable in the drum problem --- fundamentally changes the character of the inverse problem, and is one reason we conjecture that generic identifiability holds for molecules even though it fails for drums. A suggestive analogy comes from the classical theory of Sturm-Liouville operators: Borg's theorem [11] states that a one-dimensional potential is uniquely determined by two spectra (corresponding to different boundary conditions). In our setting, IR and Raman can be loosely thought of as providing two complementary "spectral views" of the same underlying force field. We emphasize, however, that this analogy is motivational rather than formal --- the mathematical structures are quite different, and our evidence for generic identifiability rests on the computational analysis presented in this paper, not on any extension of Borg's theorem.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the necessary background on the forward vibrational map (the Wilson GF method), selection rules from representation theory, and related work in both classical spectroscopy and machine learning. Section 3 develops our theoretical framework: the information completeness ratio (Theorem 1), the modal complementarity theorem (Theorem 2), and the generic identifiability conjecture (Conjecture 3), together with a Fano-inequality-based lower bound on identification error for confusable molecular sets. Section 4 describes our model architecture and training methodology. Section 5 presents experimental results on symmetry-stratified identification, modal complementarity validation, confusable set analysis, and Jacobian rank computation. Section 6 discusses implications for ML model design, connections to broader inverse problems, and limitations of the present work. Section 7 concludes.
